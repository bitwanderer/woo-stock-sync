This is a really simple WordPress plugin that syncs a Google Inventory Sheet with WooCommerce stock.

The sync is one-way only, from the Google Sheet to the Woo stock (your Woo stock will be overwritten).

The plugin uses SKU to identify the products.

How to use:

1. Download and install the plugin.
2. Create a Google Sheet with the following columns:

   - SKU
   - Stock
   - Regular Price
   - Sale Price
     
3. Publish the sheet as CSV and copy the URL
4. Go to WooCommerce --> Sheet Sync in your Dashboard
5. Fill in the sheet URL and click "Run Sync Now"

That's all!

You can add other columns with any information you like, but only the 4 listed columns will be synced.
